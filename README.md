## 👋 Hi there 

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Operational Systems Inc. I focus on writing new features for our clients utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, React, PHP, Electron. 

I'm also working on a Habit Tracker that I use regularly to help meet my annual goals. It's built with React Native.
