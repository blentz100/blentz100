## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I'm currently the Director of Student Services at Promineo Tech. We are a small but rapidly growing Education as a Service Provider that partners with
community colleges and universites across the United States. I mentor students who are learning Javascript, React, HTML, CSS and Git. I support our graduates who are working to land their first jobs in the technology industry. If you are actively looking for your first job as a software developer, don't hesitate to reach out for help.

## ðŸ“šResources for Bootcamp Students  

If you are reading this profile, there is a good chance you are a bootcamp student. Checkout this list of [resources](https://github.com/blentz100/Resources-for-Bootcamp-Students) to help you with git, github, coding challenges, interview prep and more. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

Practicing [Codewars](https://github.com/blentz100/Codewars), [Leetcode](https://github.com/blentz100/leetcode-solutions), and [freecodecamp](https://github.com/blentz100/freecodecamp-solutions) 

I do about one a day and push the solution to one of the repos above. Most (but not all) are relatively easy for me to complete. The benefits are: reinforcing concepts I've learned before, getting really good at git and github, an excuse to learn markdown, and I'm always finding ways to optimize my workflow through some scripting.  If you are learning to code, I highly recommend you get into the habit of doing one challenge or writing some code every day and committing it.
