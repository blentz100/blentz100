### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the Director of Student Services at Promineo Tech. We are a small but rapidly growing Education as a Service Provider that partners with
community colleges and universites across the United States. I help front end students with Javascript, React, HTML, CSS and Git. I help our graduates land their first jobs in the technology industry. If you want help with your job search don't hesitate to reach out - I help with resumes, cover letters, portfolio projects and overall strategy.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

Codewars coding challenges.
