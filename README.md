## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the Director of Student Services at Promineo Tech. We are a small but rapidly growing Education as a Service Provider that partners with
community colleges and universites across the United States. I help front end students with Javascript, React, HTML, CSS and Git. I help our graduates land their first jobs in the technology industry. If you want help with your job search don't hesitate to reach out - I help with resumes, cover letters, portfolio projects and overall strategy.

## ðŸ’¬ Resources for Bootcamp Students

If you are reading this profile there is a good chance you are a bootcamp student. I meet regularly with students to practice and prepare for interview. I've created two repos here that I generally ask students to work on before we meet for a mock interview. Please feel free to clone both repos and customize them for your own particular needs.
